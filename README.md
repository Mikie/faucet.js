#Disclaimer (PLEASE READ BEFORE USE)
#####We don't except nor recommend you build an entire server off of a JavaScript Interpreter, it's quite silly to do and will have serious ramifications to the servers performance. But if in fact you do, don't be surprised if the servers performance suffers. Like all JavaScript interpreters built in Java, it will run a JavaScript VM to execute all the functions of a script. And as Spigot servers are primarily single threaded, it will consume a fair bit of processing power to execute functions within the script which in turn will starve other plugins written in java and the server software itself from using those resources. 

#####Of course, we, as core contributors, will do our best to optimise this plugin to the best of our ability. But. we still do not recommend using this plugin to build an entire server off of.

The main faucet.js plugin.
